<p>This exercise is designed to give you practice with exploring text datasets (a <em>complex data type</em>). We will load, process, and engage in some discriptive/exploratory analysis of the data.</p>
<p>This dataset, titled <code>Sherlock</code>, is a package that includes text from the <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> book series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. All 48 texts are in the public domain. Information regarding copyright laws is available <a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/ascii/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I found this dataset through <a href="https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt">Emil Hvitfeldt</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/R-text-data.git">R-text-data compilation repository</a>. I also am using <a href="https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/08/03/harry-plotter-celebrating-the-20-year-anniversary-with-tidytext-the-tidyverse-and-r/">Paul Vanderlaken’s website</a> as guidance.</p>
<p>First, we will install and load the dataset.</p>

<p>Mistakenly, many people attribute the quote <a href="https://www.ihearofsherlock.com/2016/08/elementary-my-dear-watson-birth-of.html">“Elementary, my dear Watson,”</a> to the <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> series. So let’s check how many times the phrase appears in the data. For fun, we will also see if Sherlock Holmes ever calls his sidekick “John Watson” by his full name.</p>

<p>We can see that “John Watson” appears only twice, when he is writing about his own experiences. The phrase “Elementary, my dear Watson,” appears <em>zero</em> times. So, it’s a myth that Sherlock Holmes ever said this phrase in the original texts.</p>
<p>Now let’s visualize some of the words in a word cloud using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package.</p>

<p>We can see that the word “Holmes” is the most frequent word in the dataset, appearing 2403 times. This is expected, as the dataset is about Sherlock Holmes. Watson (appearing 809 times) is also quite frequent, as he is the narrator of the stories. other words that stood out to me include “London” (340 times), “police” (283 times), and “Sherlock” (383 times).</p>
