# Data source

I found this bar graph from the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/) from an article titled "What the data says about abortion in the U.S." by Jeff Diamant and Beheer Mohamed. The article explores how both abortion provision and the number of abortion facilities have changed from the legalization of abortion with *Roe v Wade* in 1973 until 2020. All data came from the Guttmacher Institute and the CDC, although I was unable to find the original data for the graph I recreated below, so I manually input the numbers into a `.csv` file.

### Original graph

Here you can see a copy of the original graph.

This shows us that the number of abortion facilities has decreased since 1982. The graph also shows the number of facilities by type, and we can see that most abortions used to be performed in hospitals, but now they are mostly performed in clinics. One misleading aspect of this graph is that it states these are the number of "providers," which implies individual physicians. This is incorrect. From looking at the [Guttmacher website](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2022/guttmacher-institute-releases-2020-abortion-provider-census-important-data-us), we can see that these are the number of facilities. I have changed the wording in my reproduced graph to better represent the data.

### Code

This was a long process for me, since I am new to creating graphics in R. First, I copied and pasted the data from my `.csv` file, which I created by hand into ChatGPT and asked it to create a dataframe using `tidyverse`. Then I asked how to reproduce these data into a bar graph using `ggplot2`. 

From there, I had to go back-and-forth to learn how to modify the colors of the bar graph and put the numbers in white text on top of each corresponding color; how to change the location of the numbers so they were in the center of each color block (this took awhile, but the `vjust` command was important); how to make sure all years were showing on the x-axis; how to change the formatting of the table title and subtitle; how to change the location of the legend; how to remove the labels on the y-axis; how to include the total numbers stacked on top of the bar graph; how to fiddle with the fonts and colors; and how to save the graph as a `.png` file.

Here is my final code:

### Graph

I was unable to include the informational text about the shift toward clinics, including the lines coming from the clinic bars in 2020. However, overall, I am pretty happy with my output. I know I need to work on removing the graph lines, and the colors really don't look as nice as the original. Any suggestions are welcome!

# Reproduced Table

Below is the code ChatGPT helped me with. I had a really hard time making the title bold and all the columns center aligned. Although, somehow, after much back-and-forth as well as going to the [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/cols_align.html) website, I succeeded. I also found looking at Taylor Glass's website helpful.

```{r}

library(gtsummary)

# Create the dataframe

  Total = c(2908, 2680, 2582, 2380, 2042, 1819, 1787, 1793, 1720, 1671, 1587, 1603),
  `Physicians' offices` = c(714, 652, 657, 636, 470, 383, 367, 332, 286, 244, 261, 266),
  Hospitals = c(1405, 1191, 1040, 855, 703, 603, 604, 610, 595, 638, 518, 530),

# Create table
table_pew <- data %>%
